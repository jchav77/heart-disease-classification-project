# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

We use a dataset containing various medical attributes of patients and whether or not they have heart disease. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease based on these attributes.

## Data

The dataset includes features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- And more...

The target variable is whether the patient has heart disease (1) or not (0).

## Methods

We employ several machine learning models:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest

After comparing these models, we focus on improving the Logistic Regression model through hyperparameter tuning.

## Results

We evaluate our models using various metrics including:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

We also visualize our results using:
- Bar plots for model comparison
- Confusion matrix for error analysis
- Feature importance plot to understand which factors are most predictive of heart disease

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn) installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to see the analysis and results.

## Future Work

Potential areas for improvement and expansion:
- Try other machine learning algorithms
- Collect more data or incorporate additional features
- Deploy the model as a simple web application for easy use by healthcare professionals
